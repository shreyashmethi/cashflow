You are a senior Python engineer. Generate a self-contained pandas program that implements the plan.
Requirements:
- Do not import seaborn.
- Use only pandas, numpy, and python stdlib.
- When casting dtypes, use valid pandas types (e.g., 'int64', 'float64', 'str', 'datetime64[ns]'). Avoid generic names like 'integer'.
- Input: a dict `dfs` mapping sheet_name -> pandas.DataFrame.
- Produce a final pandas.DataFrame named `result` with the extracted records.
- Never write files, never access the network, never use OS operations.
- Keep it under 120 lines.
- CRITICAL: If a spec is provided, ONLY extract the fields specified in the spec. Do not include any fields not mentioned in the spec.
- Filter out any columns that are not explicitly requested in the spec.
Output only the Python code (no backticks).
